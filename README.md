# DataAnalyst_WeRateDogs_project2_Udacity

This work is Part of Udacitys Data Analyst Nanodegree (Project 4). It contains mostly three parts:
1. The main work is done in the wrangle_act.ipynb notebook: There I loaded all data, cleaned it and performed my exploratory and explanatory analyses.
2. The wrangle_report: It contains a summary of the steps that I took in order to recieve a clean dataframe that could be further processed.
2. The act_report: It holds a brief summary of the results and key findings. 

All details and steps that need to be performed in order to reproduce the results can be found in the `wrangle_act.ipynb`. Some of the data required is internally from Udacity (kindly ask for permission if needed) and others can be accessed through the tweepy API that fall under the guidelines of Twitter Inc. 

In case of questions or issues, feel free to reach out to me and I will give my best to help solve the issue.
