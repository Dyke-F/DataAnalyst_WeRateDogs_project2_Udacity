## Project 4: `WeRateDogs` Twitter Analysis - Data Wrangling - Gater, asses, clean and analyse tweets about dog ratings

**`What its all about`**:  
The dataset that you will be wrangling (and analyzing and visualizing) is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because "they're good dogs Brent." WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media 'coverage.
WeRateDogs downloaded their Twitter archive and sent it to Udacity via email exclusively for you to use in this project. This archive contains basic tweet data (tweet ID, timestamp, text, etc.) for all 5000+ of their tweets as they stood on August 1, 2017.

**`Contents`**:
This work is Part of Udacitys Data Analyst Nanodegree (Project 4). It contains mostly three parts:
1. The main work is done in the wrangle_act.ipynb notebook: There I loaded all data, cleaned it and performed my exploratory and explanatory analyses.
2. The wrangle_report: It contains a summary of the steps that I took in order to recieve a clean dataframe that could be further processed.
2. The act_report: It holds a brief summary of the results and key findings. 

**`Issues`**:
All details and steps that need to be performed in order to reproduce the results can be found in the `wrangle_act.ipynb`. Some of the data required is internally from Udacity (kindly ask for permission if needed) and others can be accessed through the tweepy API that fall under the guidelines of Twitter Inc. 

In case of questions or issues, feel free to reach out to me and I will give my best to help solve the issue.
